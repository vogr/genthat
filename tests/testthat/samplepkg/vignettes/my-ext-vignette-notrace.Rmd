This one does nothing related to this package, instead, it spawns a new R
instance which does more less nothing as well. This is to test the transitivity
of the `R_PROFILE` which will be carried to other instances. There should be no
traces.

```{r}
x <- tempfile()
writeLines("ls()", x)
system2("R", c("--no-save", "--no-restore"), stdin=x)
```
